# Nashville Housing Data 

## Project Description
This project involves cleaning a dataset containing housing information in the USA using SQL.

## Data Source
The dataset was sourced from [(https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.xlsx)]. 

## Prerequisites
To replicate this data cleaning process, you will need a SQL database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).

## Data Cleaning Process

### 1. Data Import
The dataset was imported into our SQL environment using [SQL Server Import Wizard]. 

### 2. Data Exploration
We performed basic data exploration using SQL queries, including `SELECT`, `DESCRIBE`, and `COUNT`, to understand the dataset's structure and contents.

### 3. Data Cleaning
Data cleaning tasks included:
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Standardizing column names
- Transforming data types
- Filtering out irrelevant or erroneous records

### 4. Data Validation
We performed validation checks and tests to ensure data quality and integrity.

### 5. Data Export
The cleaned dataset was exported as a CSV file.
